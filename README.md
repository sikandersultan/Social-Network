## Description

Imagine, there are so many social network websites. Instagram, Snapchat so on so on. They all work well in their own regards. Now as a backend developer, I cannot nearly see enough command like interaction in ANY social website and, by the lords, usable UI. Cannot stand usable UI. So I made a MongoDB based social interaction app that can record new users, add users as one anothers friends and record user thoughts and reactions. All without a usable UI, instead just with JSON payloads. Amazing.

## Usage

This application can be started from the commandline of your choice. Note that you will need MongoDB installed and set up for this to work. Once you have cloned this repo, run the command `npm i` to install all the neccessary dependencies and such and use the command `npm start` to start up the application. You will need a program similar to Insomnia to interact with this app. Below are video links in case a visual representation is needed.
